# Project 2.1 ParallaxWorld
ParallaxWorld is a real-time human-computer interface that will help people relax using parallax views. It tracks peoples eye position to create a parallax effect and with hand movements users can switch between the three different scenes: main, jungle and underwater. 

## Quick start:

1. Download the project and open it with your IDE. 
2. Make sure you have python (version 3.11 or higher) and unity (version 6000.0.26f1) installed.
3. Run the main.py file and make sure your webcam is working.
4. Open 'ParallaxWorld' with Unity.
5. Open and run the file 'Assets/Scenes/FinalWater.unity'

#### Switching between scenes
1. From the main scene you can go to the jungle scene by opening your left hand (make a fist -> make a flat hand) and the underwater scene by opening your right hand.
2. From both the jungle and the underwater scene you can go back to the main scene by closing your hand (make a flat hand -> make a fist).
